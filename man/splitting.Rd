\usage{
split_sections(x, str_pattern = NULL, split_sec_lim = 3, split_args = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A character vector containing the path to an Rmd file or the actual
text from an Rmd file.}

\item{str_pattern}{A named vector where names are patterns to match in
the document's text and values are the replacements for those patterns.
Passed to the \code{pattern} argument of \link[stringr]{str_replace_all}.
Defaults to no substitution.}

\item{split_sec_lim}{An integer specifying the maximum heading size (number)
of "#" to be considered. Sub-sections lower than that won't be split.}

\item{split_args}{A list of 'splits' to separate the sections and blocks.
See the source code of \code{morphdown:::apply_splits} for the default splits,
and \code{morphdown:::split_match} to see how they work.}
}
\value{
A named list of character vectors. Each vector is a section named
\verb{s*}. Each section has blocks named \verb{b*}. Use those names to refer to each
in the plan functions.
}
\description{
This function takes a path to an R Markdown (.Rmd) file or a string vector of
text from an Rmd file, cleans it by replacing specified patterns, and then
splits it into sections and blocks. The result makes it easy to refer to each
section/block with the plan functions of the package.
